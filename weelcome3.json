Suggestions are always welcome and will be considered by community vote.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Territory & Tribal Claims</>\n• Each Tribe may claim two bases per map. Base sizes must not cause lag or fence large areas.\n• Solo players may have one base per map.\n• If a solo player joins a tribe, their solo base must be dismantled and merged into the tribe’s official stronghold.\n• Claiming more than the allowed base locations will result in admin action.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Building With Balance</>\n• Build freely but keep performance and fairness in mind.\n• Planning a mega base? Request admin approval before expanding beyond normal limits.\n• You may not block: high-resource zones, explorer notes, artifact caves or terminals.\n• No structure spam. Taming traps must be cleaned up after use.",
          "text2": "<TextStyle.Violet>Code of the Wild</>\n• No offline breeding — imprinting and care matter.\n• No egg theft. Respect other survivors' lineages.\n• Harassment is not tolerated. Resolve internal tribe disputes privately — admins are not mediators.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>The Harsh Truth</>\n• Lost a tame or gear? Ark is unforgiving. Admins will not replace gameplay losses. In rare server-error cases, the community may receive token compensation.\n• Abandoned creatures left at other players’ bases or on obelisks will be wiped without warning.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Disciplinary Path (The Rule of Three)</>\n1) First Offense: Verbal warning + 24-hour notice to correct (posted in Discord).\n2) Second Offense: Involved structures, tames, or players may be wiped. Failure to correct after the 24-hour window = automatic second offense.\n3) Third Offense (within 30 days): Permanent banishment from the cluster.\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Honor the Pride</>\nReport violations to admins. Players who support the server and uphold rules will be rewarded with generous gifts and recognition.",

Items, tames, and whole bases may be salvaged and auctioned.\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Normal Players</>\n• Must update their tribe's flag before the end of each month.\n• Next required flag color announced one week in advance.\n• Failure to update before the first wipe wave = tribe wiped on that map, no compensation.\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Subscribed Players</>\n• Change flag every 3 months. Schedule notices will be given.\n• Cancel subscription and the tribe must follow the Normal Player schedule thereafter.\n• If you stop playing and inform admins, we will remove the base; items and tames may be auctioned. Noteworthy bases may be auctioned intact.\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Admins</>\n• Admins also must change flags every 3 months.\n• Failure to update results in tribe wipe and possible auctioning of items/tames or whole base.",
