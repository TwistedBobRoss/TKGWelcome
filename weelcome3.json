Obey them, or risk the wrath of the wild... and the whiskers.\nSuggestions are always welcome — your voice matters in the pride.\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>Territory & Tribal Claims</>\n- Each Tribe may claim two bases within each map. Each must not cause lag or fence in huge swaths of land.\n- Lone wolves (solo players) may also have one of each.\n- If a solo player joins a tribe, their base must be dismantled and merged into the tribe’s official stronghold.\n- Claiming more than allowed base locations will result in admin action.\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>Building With Balance</>\n- Build your dream sanctuary — clean, fair, and performance-friendly.\n- Planning a mega base? Request admin approval before expanding beyond the norm.\n- Do not block high-resource zones, explorer notes, or artifact caves.\n- If unsure, ask before building.\n- No structure spam. Taming traps must be cleaned up after use.\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>Code of the Wild</>\n- No offline breeding.\n- No egg theft.\n- Harassment is never tolerated.\n- Trust is earned — admins are not referees for tribe drama.\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>The Harsh Truth</>\n- Lost tames or loot? That’s Ark.\n- Admins will not replace losses.\n- Admin support is handled in order received.\n- Abandoned creatures left at others’ bases or obelisks will be wiped without warning.",
