After speaking with the creator of CS and reviewing our logs together, she confirmed that there is a logic issue affecting that specific part of the mod. She did not provide details on the exact cause, only that the issue has been identified and will be fixed in the next update. Until that update is released, we will be adding the APD Recovery Stone back to the cluster, and once the CS Gravestone update is live and we have thoroughly tested it, we will remove the APD Recovery Stone again as long as everything is working correctly. We have added APD Recovery stone back to the server now and it will remain until the CS Update.

These are the rules that keep chaos in check. Obey them, or risk the wrath of the wild... and the whiskers.\nSuggestions are always welcome — your voice matters in the pride.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Territory & Tribal Claims</>\nEach Tribe may claim two bases within each map. The size of each must not cause other players lag or fence in huge swaths of land. In the future there may be a device provided to illustrate your limitations.\nLone wolves (solo players) may also have one of each.\nIf a solo player joins a tribe, their base must be dismantled and merged into the tribe’s official stronghold.\n\nClaiming more than your allowed base locations will result in admin action.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Building With Balance</>\n• Feel free to build your dream sanctuary — just keep it clean, fair, and performance-friendly.\n• Planning a mega base?  Request approval from an admin before expanding beyond the norm.\n• You may not block:\n→ High-resource zones\n→ Explorer Notes\n→ Artifact caves or terminals\n\nNo structure spam.\nTaming traps must be cleaned up after use. Don’t litter the land.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>Code of the Wild</>\nNo offline breeding — your babies deserve attention.\nNo egg theft — what hatches in your nest stays in your nest.\nHarassment is never tolerated. Respect your fellow survivors.\nTrust is earned — we are not referees for tribe drama. Handle it like grown kittens.\n\n<TextStyle.Violet>The Harsh Truth</>\nLost a tame? A bag full of loot vanished? That’s Ark.\nAdmins will not replace losses — this is a survival game, and tragedy is part of the tale.\nAdmin support is handled in order received, and as time allows.\nWe’re human too, with jobs, families, and naps to take.\nAbandoned creatures left at others’ bases or obelisks will be wiped without mercy or warning.\n\n<TextStyle.Red>Disciplinary Path (The Rule of Three)</>\nFirst Offense – Verbal warning + 24hr notice to fix the issue (posted in Discord)\nSecond Offense – Involved structures, tames, or players may be wiped\nFailure to correct the issue after 24hr = automatic second offense\nThird Offense (within 30 days) – Permanent banishment from the pride\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Honor the Pride</>\nReport rule-breakers to an admin\nThose who support the server, uphold the rules, and help the pride flourish will be rewarded with generous gifts and eternal kitten approval.\nThe ARK is brutal.
